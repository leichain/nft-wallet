The sensation can be so powerful it can be overwhelming, it's such an unbearable feeling. But going through it is human, and it's part of a healing process.

This is the beginning of a series of pieces where I want to express emotions through color and brushstrokes. It's also a very personal step for me as an artist, as I'm finding my own style, the way I want my work to be recognized for.

If you buy this token, be sure to send me an email at diego@neondistrict.io so I can send you the high resolution painting, 2 phone wallpapers and 1 for desktop as well as a process timelapse video.</p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6ROiRhTpiKtezFpbKq9RwG9Ufh1gRvBWFTHpk0yj64S5zJYGj_4yoOMsV-RJBtsAW9Pp5BLkbCjWfZyjlar1KcqR"></div><div class="nft-card"><h2>AUTHENTIC Yield Farmer Limited Edition (@yield_farmer on Twitter) (ALEX)</h2><p>Very honest NFT.

Our tagline is literally, ""Since 1980,"" because that was the year that the founders were born. Dimensional Adam sprouted from an era rich in design and illustration: 3D shapes, pop art and geometric shapes.| Background Story: 
Originating in Scotland as ""tartan,"" we now call this pattern of crisscrossed lines ""Plaid."" Growing up in Southern California during the '80s and '90s, plaid beach volleyball shorts were always in our purview, thanks to labels like Mossimo and Stüssy. When we elevated to making cut-n-sew apparel like button-ups in the early 2000s, plaids made their way into our language as a nod to both the surf culture of the West Coast and Polo's influence on the East. In fact, every plaid speaks to a different subculture. Buffalo plaids were woven into the early New York hip-hop lumberjacks. Shadow plaids on swap meet Pendletons. And The Hundreds plaids, for all.</p><img src="https://nftassets.covalenthq.com/39794525ea118e56259647e0f5f3f362a2f58fdef6982dd883930cdcac01c21c.png"></div><div class="nft-card"><h2>frontierwallet.crypto (UD)</h2><p>A CNS or UNS blockchain domain.
