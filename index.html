Snowfro) has been intrigued by the idea of representing digital artwork in the physical world in the form of an ephemeral physical object with meaning, but with no inherent value. 

Donald Judd has long been an inspiration for Art Blocks. One aspect we admire most about Judd‚Äôs artistic practice is the elegance of design he effortlessly paired with the accessibility of materials that could be found at a hardware store. With Judd as inspiration, we hatched a plan to create a unique generative art friendship bracelet that includes instructions to make, in minutes, a simple bracelet using a few dollars‚Äô worth of embroidery floss. Donald Judd believed that what surrounds us in our day-to-day life is already so beautiful, and that ultimately the experience of creating art is as important as owning it.

Erick was incredibly excited to collaborate with renowned artist Alexis Andr√© (a.k.a. MacTuitui) to bring generative art and ephemeral physical objects together in the form of friendship bracelets. Conceptualized by Erick and aesthetically and programmatically designed by Alexis, this project pairs creative coding with a beautiful spectrum of embroidery floss colors. The project was a true team effort, as each member of the Art Blocks team designed and named their own color palette!

The project is a token of our appreciation to the creators, makers, builders, and collectors who have all contributed to making the Art Blocks community what it is today. Participating in this project is a signal, both online and IRL, that you‚Äôre a participant in this evolution of art + community. You are pushing the best ideas forward. You are the reason all of these imaginative projects come to life. Our community is what makes all of this possible. So, to say it plainly, we appreciate you, and we hope that you‚Äôll accept this bracelet as a token of our special friendship!

The owner of any wallet with an Art Blocks piece at the time of snapshot (October 26, 2022, at 3pm US Central time) is eligible to claim two mints from this special generative art project. We would love to see you keep one bracelet and share your love for generative art by gifting your second mint! These mints are free to claim (you pay only the gas) and exist on L1 Ethereum. Please note that we may in the future release additional modified iterations of the Friendship Bracelets project, ideally on an L2 scaling solution, that may substantially increase the total supply of tokens related to the project, with the intent of being a more accessible entry point to a larger audience. But this version is what we're here to celebrate today, and this gift is for you in gratitude for your support along the way. Please enjoy this token of our friendship and explore the wonderful artwork created by Alexis Andr√©. Then, let's all make bracelets together! 

Warmly,
Alexis + Erick + the Art Blocks team



The claim window expires on January 10, 2023, at noon US Central time.

the fruit resembles 
a dragon egg

one might look like.
Beneath the spiky shield
is the orange pulp,
so rich in carotenoids
and fatty acids,
surrounding a large seed.
The scales need scraped off

or just bitten off.
The fruit can be eaten fresh

in popsicles and ice cream.
Its flavor is hard to compare
like tamarind maybe

Its conceptually layered armature and visually poetic distillation process encourage us to experience the full bandwidth of a visceral nostalgia in locating the pulse of a lost paradise we refer to as ‚Äúour youth‚Äù.

Remixed source material are reduced to shimmering pixelated outlines dancing across a contrasting dark digital canvas co-inhabited by scrolling text (appropriated from 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs era song lyrics), functioning as internal dialogue and instinctive meta prose. These motifs operate on the subconscious level wherein the visible and symbolic merge to produce evocative allusions referred to as vignettes, which are divided into three categorical types: Moments, Objects, and Mementos.

Combining these vignettes into diptychs and triptychs engenders the transmission of personal narratives and private myths. Such permutations symbolize the piecing together of fragmented memories, as if downloading one‚Äôs own recollective echo to ultimately reveal an intrinsic cerebral blueprint‚Äîinviting
us to reflect and reconcile with the forces and events that have shaped our present selves.</p><img src="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQHzohyH6U4unk3cDJtgyxzNirY3tit6AscqQzaqPS3Fm/633e1cb1b1de13a457df3e2f.mp4"><p class="token-id">Token ID: 640016</p></div><div class="nft-card"><h2>Known Origin</h2><p>Dedicated to the Known Origins marketplace this digital artwork is set in a Known Origin inspired universe giving the viewer an abstract concept in the mind of a creative.</p><img src="https://nftassets.covalenthq.com/333722d79d8a2fb91a77f2115b79e0ed76dc372ebd4166570b596896df37eba4.png"><p class="token-id">Token ID: 73098</p></div><div class="nft-card"><h2>Portal N¬∫ 1</h2><p>Portal is an audiovisual shrine devoted to strobes, bass and dark rooms.

The sublime begs your notice.
Blessings unheeded.

In the spirit of joyfully greeting a new day with positive affirmations, I have prepared a wish for you, a mantra, a blessing.   With a twist.  Encouraging you to slow down amidst all the chaos of daily living, the wish must be decoded rather than instantly absorbed as you race along.  Harking back to a time of slower pleasures, I‚Äôve used Samuel‚Äôs code to express my greeting.

At sellout or the expiration of 3 months from the drop date, whichever comes first, I will randomly select a collector to be included as a collaborator on my next one of one piece, splitting secondary sales with them in perpetuity.  The number of chances in the drawing will be equal to the number of items minted.
